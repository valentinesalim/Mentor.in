# Mentor.in project 
Mentor.in is an online learning platform that pairs individuals with role models from their targeted universities and companies in various subjects.
We submitted this project to [Garudahacks Hackaton](https://devpost.com/software/mentor-in-69j1u7) and won 'Innovation Hack of The Year' prize.

# Inspiration:
Fun Fact: how we get our name, Mentor.in is a verb of Mentoring in Indonesian language.

“The information in textbooks is not necessarily what you need or would like to have at your fingertips.” That’s when we realise the great benefit of having a mentor. Having guidance, encouragement and support from trusted mentors can help us with a broad range of professional benefits. Not only can you learn whatever you want in any interest you have, but you learn it directly from someone who is already in that field of expertise.

# Problems:
There’s no education-dedicated platform for mentors to post about their upcoming talks/webinars in Indonesia, which usually end up being shared through their social media (instagram, facebook, personal website). We see that as a problem because education content can easily get distracted by other entertainment content. On the other hand, the distribution of that talks/webinars information is usually very limited (only within followers/ friends of the mentors), which makes it even worse because the information wasn’t evenly distributed and not optimal.

As a student, finding a mentor can be difficult. There is a fear of approaching someone and asking for advice, especially when you haven’t met or known the mentor in person. That’s where Mentor.in comes in. Mentor.in is an online learning platform that allows you to connect and learn directly from your mentors and industry experts from any area of your interest. Mentors can create live-classes to share their knowledge and experience with bigger audiences, students can find the class easily and ask questions to the mentors, so it’s a win-win. We hope to bridge that gap and encourage all professionals to join our platform and make an impact.
